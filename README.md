# OOP-assessment
There is a zip file of the project before the assessment was due in (before feedback).

There is also 4 documents containing the code for quick and easy access, one for each class (this was added after the assignment was due).

There is also a zip file of the completed project after the assignment was due, with amendments based on feedback from the assignment.

The Code Review Process
1. I finished my code
2. I asked my peers to review my code
3. I recieved responses
4. I replied to responses and acted upon feedback
